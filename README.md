# OpenVPNFrontend
A simple frontend for OpenVPN in GNU/Linux. At the moment it doesn't have a fancy GUI, but I prefer it to KDE or Gnome Network Manager.

## Requirements
You need Linux operating system which supports systemd and of course OpenVPN!

## How to Install
Go to source directory and run the following commands:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```
